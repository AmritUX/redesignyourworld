    <h2>Rebranding and redesigning Lotus Dancers' website</h2>
    <p><br />
    One of my most favourite project, because I was given the opportunity to leave an impact on women’s life in the world of dance. Gauri is a dance-teacher who owns a dance school in Basel, Switzerland. I redesigned the client’s website, digital presence and branding guidelines.

     <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>The previous website didn’t reflect a dance school but merely a personal website of a dance instructor.</li>
    <li>Gauri's dance school was not established as a recognizable organization.</li>
    <li>Gauri's brand did not have a solid digital presence.</li>
    </ul>

           <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>Students and non-students missed a connection with Gauri’s brand.</li>
    <li>Students felt that there was no pride associated with Gauri's brand</li>
    <li>Potential students found the older website unclear and difficult to understand.</li>
    <li>Many dance schools’ websites and online presence were too much focused on the teacher and not the students.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="column">
 <h2>The Solutions</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>Gauri's brand transitioned from a personal brand to a business brand named the Lotus Dancers.</li>
    <li>User-centred guidelines was established across instagram, facebook and the newly created Lotus Dancers website.</li>
    <li>The lotus dancers website was created with the students in mind. As the website has now clear-to-understand tabs, information and a call for action for the recruitment of potential students.</li>
