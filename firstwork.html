     <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>Overflow and scattered files from First Work.</li>
    <li>Events, webinars, bulletins and other First Work’s activities were hosted on separate online platforms which caused issues to retrieve, read and download information by the user.</li>
    <li>Evaluating and setting up the flow of the member portal.</li>
    <li>Selecting the right online platform that could host the member portal.</li>
    </ul>

           <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>The members mainly consist of youth employment service provider and would need a portal where info is relevant to their niche.</li>
    <li>The members would like to have all their regional agenda and minutes easily accessable in the portal.</li>
    <li>The member desires to download presentations of conferences, webinars and events.</li>
    <li>Wild Apricot member management software is the best suitable software for the portal because of user-centred features, reasonable price and ease of use for both First Work’s staff and members.</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>The Solutions</h2>
    <p><br />
    <ul> 
    <li>Wild Apricot was decided for the member portal because the software is the one-solution platform where all of First Work’s activities can be hosted including online payment and registration.</li>
    <li>Designed a communication model where members can stay up-to-date on First Work’s involvements, activities and news.</li>
    <li>Members can retrieve and read all information regarding youth employment in the member portal oppose to looking for information on the internet.</li>
